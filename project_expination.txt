This project was developed as a stipend-based real-time SQL project.
I was responsible for designing the complete database schema,
writing SQL queries, optimizing performance using indexes,
and implementing triggers and stored procedures.

The database supports hospital operations such as:
patient registration, doctor scheduling, room allocation,
billing, payment tracking, and pharmacy inventory.
