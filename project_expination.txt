This project was developed as a stipend-based real-time SQL project.
I was responsible for designing the complete database schema,
writing SQL queries, optimizing performance using indexes,
and implementing triggers and stored procedures.

The database supports hospital operations such as:
patient registration, doctor scheduling, room allocation,
billing, payment tracking, and pharmacy inventory.


NOTE:
 This SQL file contains a SAMPLE version of the actual
 hospital database created during a stipend-based project.
 The schema structure, tables, relationships, and queries
 represent the real-world design, while the data included
 here is mock/sample data used for demonstration purposes.

 The queries included in this project are designed to
 showcase important business and operational insights such as:
  - Total payments and hospital revenue
  - Patient billing information
  - Medicine stock availability
  - Currently admitted patients
 These queries can be further used for:
  Data analysis and reporting
  Dashboard creation (Power BI / Excel / Tableau)
  Business decision-making
 Understanding hospital operational data which comes in data analayst field 

 This project focuses on database design, data integrity,
 and analytical querying using PostgreSQL.
